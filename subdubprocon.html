<h1 class="text-center"><u>Subbed Anime: Pros</u></h1>
<div class="row">
</div>
</div>
<h2><b><P>Pros for watching Subbed anime include the funny <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Engrish</a> that happens sometimes (which can be either a pro, or con depending on if you care about English sounding right or not), there's also the fact you can watch the anime without any unnecessary censoring, meaning you can see all the gore the Western censors edit out (obviously there are some things that have to be censored no matter what, but most things that are censored in Dubbed anime are uncensored in the Sub), there's also the fact that not all subbed anime get dubbed, so there's more anime to watch if you watch subbed anime.</P></b></h2>
<div class="container">
<h1 class="text-center"><u>Subbed Anime: Cons</u></h1>
<div class="row">
</div>
</div>
<h2><b><P>Cons for watching Subbed anime includes having to take your eyes away from the action to look down at the subtitles to understand what the characters are saying, which can be a pain if you want to know what they're saying and watch the action at the same time.</P></b></h2>
<div class="container">
<h1 class="text-center"><u>Dubbed Anime: Pros</u></h1>
<div class="row">
</div>
</div>
<h2><b><P>Pros for watching Dubbed anime includes not having to look towards the bottom of the screen to understand the characters, then there's the fact that some characters might be more likeable/less anoying in the dub than in the sub. There is also something called "Western Anime", which is anime created in the West, like America that are created in English, so they are the originals, and there are Japanese dubs.</P></b></h2>
<div class="container">
<h1 class="text-center"><u>Dubbed Anime: Cons</u></h1>
<div class="row">
</div>
</div>
<h2><b><P>Cons for watching Dubbed anime includes the censors censoring profound things like half the screen for a smidge of blood, or editing out weapons. Things like the weapons are sorta understandable due to the censors wanting to keep the anime family friendly, but others are just too idiotic to even consider protecting, like not editing something else in to ensure the character isn't floating on a stick, theres also the fact that not every episode of a series might not get a dubbed version.</P></b></h2>
<div class="container">
<h1 class="text-center"><u>Manga</u></h1>
<div class="row">
</div>
</div>
<h2><b><p>Manga is the written form of Anime, as such, it means you have a physical (or digital if you prefer to read online) copy of your favorite anime, in book form, that you can read at your lesure instead of watching episodes unitl the end, but people might prefer to watch the action unfold, and hear the characters, instead of reading what's happening, and whilst the manga are generally created first, there are instances of Anime being created before the Manga. But that being said, due to the fact the manga is more often than not created first, that means there's more to read than watch, and not all manga get adapted into an anime.</p></b></h2>
