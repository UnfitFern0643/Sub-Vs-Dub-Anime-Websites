<h2><b><P>The (commonly regarded) 1st ever anime was called Dekobō Shingachō: Meian no Shippai (which translates to"Bumpy new picture book – Failure of a great plan" in English) which is 40 seconds long and was created by<a href= "http://rarebit.org/?people=oten-shimokawa">"Ōten Shimokawa</a>" which aired in cinemas in Japan in January of 1917, but there was an animation created before that, but lost until 2005 called Katsudō Shashin (which translates to "Moving Picture" in English)which is 3 seconds long, was created between 1907 and 1911, and is known as "The Matsumoto Fragment" after the person who found it: Natsuki Matsumoto. But there are rumors of an even older anime released in January of 1917, but it is an unconfirmed and unnamed film with no copies left intact, so we can not say if these rumors are true or not. There was also a time in which Imokawa Mukuzo Genkanban no Maki (which translates to "The Story of the Concierge Mukuzo Imokawa" in English") was stated to be the oldest anime in the world being introduced in cinemas in April of 1917, which was also created by Ōten Shimokawa.</P></b></h2>
