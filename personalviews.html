<h2><b><P>Before we begin, please note that these are just my own personal opinions, and that your opinions may differ from my own. Now, with that out of the way, let's begin. Both sides of this argument have their pros and cons for watching anime in either Sub or Dub, but I'm with the 3rd option; Watching Both. There are some anime I prefer to watch with subtitles, and there are others that I prefer watching with English VAs (Voice Actors). Whilst I do think that anime should be censored if it's aimed at kids, censors should at least try to make the censors seem natural, but not every anime needs censoring. As for the manga, they can be a fun read, even if you've already watched the anime, and there's also the fact that there might be a few changes that was made to the anime, so I think that reading the manga can be a relaxing way to spend your time. You might also find a manga/anime that you enjoy by watching/reading the corresponding anime/manga. And whilst I've tried explaining the arguments surrounding Sub Vs Dub Anime, <a href="https://animemotivation.com/subbed-vs-dubbed-anime/">Anime Motivation</a> does a much better job at going into the exact reasons, I am mearly giving an overview and my own personal opinions.</P></b></h2>
