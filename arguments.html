<div class="row">
</div>
</div>
<h2><b><P>Arguments for watching subbed anime includes the fact that you are able to watch the anime as it was created in Japan, meaning without any extra censors, and "purests" will say about how it's sub or nothing, but with subbed anime, you can learn Japanese whilst watching what's going on, an example would be "Itadakimasu" meaning "Thank you for this meal".</P></b></h2>

<div class="row">
</div>
</div>
<h2><b><P>Arguments against watching subbed anime includes the fact that unless you speak Japanese, you don't understand a thing they're saying, and that you need to look at the subtitles to understand them, which takes you away from the action on screen, there's also the "purest" fanbase, which is toxic to the fanbase that likes watching dubbed anime, and putting others off of watching either subbed anime, or anime in general.</P></b></h2>

</div>
<h2><b><P>Arguments against watching dubbed anime includes the fact that censors ruin the anime by over-censoring things like with <a href="https://dubbing.fandom.com/wiki/4Kids_Entertainment">4Kids</a> being one of, if not <b>THE</b> worst offender for this.</P></b></h2>
<div class="container">
<h1 class="text-center"><u>Manga</u></h1>
</div>
<h2><b><p>Manga are generally what Anime is created from, and because of that, it means that the Manga are more often than not, created first, as such, there is more Manga to read than Anime to watch, but keep in mind that the anime might change the story a bit, for better, or worse.</p></b></h2>
